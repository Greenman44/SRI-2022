Another example of a moral system ispresented within the Declaration of Independence, which states that weshould be guaranteed life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  You see,to have a moral system, we must define the purpose of the system.  That is,we shall be moral unto what end?>>Murder is certainly a violation of the golden rule.

That there was>some kind of \"objective\" morality, and that an example of that was>that murder is wrong.   If you don't want to claim that any more,>that's fine.Well, murder violates the golen rule, which is certainly a pillar of mostevery moral system.  However, I am not assuming that our current systemand the manner of its implementation are objectively moral.  I think thatit is a very good approximation, but we can't be perfect.>And by the way, you don't seem to understand the difference between>\"arbitrary\" and \"objective\".   If Keith Schneider \"defines\" murder>to be this that and the other, that's arbitrary.
