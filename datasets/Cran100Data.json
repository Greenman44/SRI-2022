      "body" : "vibration isolation of aircraft power plants . vibration in aircraft structure can almost always be traced to vibratory forces originating from the power plant .  these forces are transmitted to the aircraft in two ways ..  (1) by the action of air forces upon the surfaces of the aircraft in, or adjacent to, the slip stream of the propeller, and (2) by direct transmission of unbalanced forces from the power plant through the engine mounting .  the latter has always caused the preponderance of disturbance . vibratory stresses induced in the engine mounting structure occasionally produce fatigue failures in the associated parts, and always shorten the useful life of the entire aircraft structure .  more important, however, are the psychological and physiological effects of continuous vibration and its attendant noise on the passengers and crew .  this may very likely be the major source of the rapid fatigue which is so intimately associated with flying .  the importance and desirability of drastically reducing vibration can hardly be questioned .   this paper is limited to a consideration of the directly transmitted forces and, further, considers the power plants as rigid bodies attached by flexible means to the aircraft which is also considered as a rigid body of relatively large mass .  it is also limited to the case of engines and engine supporting structures having axial symmetry (radial engines), although the methods employed could easily be extended to other cases .",

(a) thermodynamic equilibrium, in which the chemical reaction rates are regarded as /very fast/ compared to the rates of diffusion across streamlines., (b) diffusion as rate-governing, in which the volume recombination rates within the boundary layer are /very slow/ compared to diffusion across streamlines .  in either case the gas density near the surface of a blunt-nosed body is much higher than the density just outside the boundary layer, and the velocity and stagnation enthalpy profiles are much less sensitive to pressure gradient than in the more familiar case of moderate temperature differences .  in fact, in case (a), the nondimensionalized enthalpy gradient at the surface is represented very accurately by the /classical/ zero pressure gradient value, and the surface heat-transfer rate distribution is obtained directly in terms of the surface pressure distribution .  in order to illustrate the method, this solution is applied to the special cases of an unyawed hemisphere and an unyawed, blunt cone capped by a spherical segment . in the opposite limiting case where diffusion is rate-controlling the diffusion equation for each species is reduced to the same form as the low-speed energy equation, except that the prandtl number is replaced by the schmidt number .  the simplifications introduced in case (a) are also applicable here, and the expression for surface heat transfer rate is similar., the maximum value of the ratio between the rate of heat transfer by diffusion alone and by heat conduction alone in the case of thermodynamic equilibrium is given by..  (prandtl no./schmidt no .) when the diffusion coefficient is estimated by taking a reasonable value of atom-molecule collision cross section this ratio is 1.30 . additional theoretical and (especially) experimental studies are clearly required before these simple results are accepted .",

      "body" : "fundamentals of boundary layer heat transfer with streamwise temperature variations .   boundary-layer heat transfer is analyzed for the case of a sinusoidal distribution of temperature in the direction of flow .  it is shown that for both laminar and turbulent flow the spatial distribution of heat transfer is generally out of phase with the wall temperature by an angle of 30 to 45 .  this leads to the conclusion that in some areas the heat flow is opposite to the temperature difference as used in the definition of the heat-transfer coefficient, and points to the basic shortcomings of this concept . the physical explanation for this behavior is found to be the temperature-field distortion by the fluid motion .  the distortion is measured by the peclet number .  approximate equations representing a /conduction analogy/ were used in this analysis and the validity of these equations for unsteady flow is examined with reference to limitations in frequency and wavelength .  a solution of these equations is given for the case of a velocity profile which is not a straight line .  the use of previously developed variational principles for the evaluation of convective heat transfer including cases of three-dimensional unsteady flow, turbulence, and nonparallel streamlines is also discussed .",

      "body" : "the use of models for the determination of critical flutter speeds . the use of model tests in the prediction of full-scale critical flutter speeds is now well established, and the technique of such tests is therefore worthy of discussion . in order to obtain critical speeds for the model within the speed range of ordinary wind tunnels it is necessary that the model should differ in some respect from a mere small suggested by mckinnon wood the modification of the model consists in a reduction of its effective stiffnesses . this method has the defect /in most cases probably not serious/ that the model experiment is conducted at a reynolds number much below that for full-scale . in the present paper it is pointed out that an alternative method of reducing the critical speed is to increase the mass loading of the model and to make the flutter tests in compressed air . * it is then quite feasible to reach the full-scale reynolds number . this method of reducing the critical speeds by a proportionate increase of all effective densities may also be combined with a reduction of the elasticity of the model . the relation of model and full-scale stresses at the critical flutter speeds is considered . where the reduction in critical speed is effected  by increase of density only, the model and full-scale stresses are equal . in a model of reduced elasticity the stresses in the wires are the same as for full-scale,  whereas, the stresses in the spars are less  than for full-scale . this is in accord with the usual experience that the wires of such a model are the first parts of the structure to fail in a flutter . lastly, the influence of gravity on flutter is considered . this is negligibly small for full-scale, but not necessarily so for the model . gravitational effects can sometimes be corrected by suitable orientation  of the model .",
